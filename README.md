# Language_bot

Develop an AI-powered educational chatbot that is capable of answering questions from the Class 12 NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) textbook. The primary objective of the chatbot is to provide accurate answers to user queries directly from the textbook, including page number references, and to recommend related questions from the same chapter and concept.

Key Features and Objectives:

##Textbook Integration: 
The chatbot should be trained on the Class 12 NCERT textbook for various subjects to extract relevant information.
##Question Answering (QA): 
The bot should have a robust QA system that can understand and answer a wide range of questions related to the textbook content. Answers should be precise and contextually accurate.
##Page Number Reference: 
Whenever possible, the bot should provide the page number from the NCERT textbook where the answer can be found.
##Question Recommendation: 
In addition to answering the user's question, the bot should recommend the top 5 related questions from the same chapter and concept to encourage further learning.

##Natural Language Understanding (NLU): 
The chatbot should be able to understand natural language queries, including synonyms, paraphrases, and context, to provide relevant answers.
##User Interface: 
Develop a user-friendly interface, such as a chat window or web application, where users can input their questions.
##Chapter and Concept Mapping: 
The bot should be capable of identifying the specific chapter and concept to retrieve relevant answers and recommend related questions.
##Scalability: 
Ensure that the bot can be easily scaled to include content from different subjects and textbooks in the future.
##Accuracy and Reliability: 
The bot should strive for high accuracy in answering questions and provide reliable references to the textbook.
##User Feedback: 
Implement a feedback system to continuously improve the bot's performance based on user input.
